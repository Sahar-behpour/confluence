                            The BCAC is a forum of investigators interested in the inherited risk of breast cancer. The aim of the consortium is to combine data from many studies, and to provide a reliable assessment of the risks associated with these gene.

                            The AABCG is a collaboration of investigators focused on identifying novel genetic susceptibility factors for breast cancer in African-ancestry women and evaluating the influence of germline risk variants on breast cancer biology.

                            LAGENO-BC is a collaborative effort including a multinational team of investigators sharing knowledge and materials to facilitate breast cancer genetics research relevant to the diverse populations of Latin America and its diaspora.

                            TheÂ CIMBA was formed by a collaborative group of researchers working on genetic modifiers of cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. The aim of CIMBA is to provide sufficient sample sizes to allow large scale studies in order to evaluate reliably the effects of genetic modifiers.
